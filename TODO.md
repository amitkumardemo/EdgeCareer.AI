# TODO: Enhance Course Recommendation System

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Update actions/course-recommendation.js to use Gemini AI for personalized course recommendations based on skills and career goal
- [ ] Add YouTube API integration to fetch popular playlists related to skills/goal
- [ ] Modify app/api/course-recommendation/route.js to return both Coursera courses and YouTube playlists
- [ ] Update app/(main)/course-recommendation/page.jsx to display two separate sections: Coursera courses and YouTube playlists
- [ ] Test API integrations (Gemini, YouTube API) and verify UI displays correctly
- [ ] Handle loading states and errors for both sections
